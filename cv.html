		<h1>Marton Farago</h1>
		<h3>CTO, Head of Product, Full Stack Engineer</h3>
		<h4>Berlin, Germany</h4>



		<p>I was the co-founder of two online startups. While my responsibilities were mainly technical, as a co-founder I often had to venture into other areas, giving me a very broad understanding of how online companies work.</p>

		<p>I have:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Turned complex business requirements into simple functional specifications and UI prototypes</li>
			<li>Selected technologies and planned system architecture</li>
			<li>Supervised development, hired staff, selected and handled subcontractors</li>
			<li>Managed budgets and controlled costs</li>
			<li>Even created the first MVP</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I have deep experience in:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Front and back-end development and frameworks (Vue.js, PHP, Go)</li>
			<li>Mobile app development (Android SDK, Java)
			<li>Databases (MySQL, ElasticSearch)</li>
			<li>Build and deployment tools (Gulp, Grunt)</li>
			<li>Version control</li>
			<li>Automated testing</li>
			<li>Performance tuning</li>
		</ul>

		<p>My public projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/interferenc">github</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/interferenc">gitlab</a>.</p>
