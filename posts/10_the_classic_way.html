When I started building websites around 20 years ago, the internet was a very different place. Websites were mostly used for what they were designed for originally: as documents, for sharing information.

If you needed anything more interactive than that, you had to resort to simple HTML forms and some server side scripts to process them. That simple request/response dance allowed us create very nice and useful websites.

Then our idea of a website evolved. Users started to want better experiences, and simple static HTML forms were not able to deliver that. So we started using client side scripts to make the experience better. This allowed us to create almost kind of application that ran in the browser. Around this time I stopped calling them websites, they became web applications. 

Althought I started calling them applications, I still treated them as websites. Initially I just used javascript and document.write, then jQuery and the DOM. It took a very long time for me to realize that a web application is no different then a desktop or mobile native application. It has all the same problems and it needs to handle them all. 

Nowdays, jumping into web development looks easy. Look at all those quick start guides for Vue.js. Just throw and axios call in the `onMounted` method and you are good to go. No you're not. That is not good enough. 

It is very hard to find the actual best practices of creating web applications, so I decided to share my journey in case it might be helpful for others.
